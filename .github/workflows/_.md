# YAML Snippets

## Try on Current Workflow

```yaml
# pull_request:
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
    paths:
      - '**.html'
      - '**.js'
      - '**.jsx'
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - '**.mdx'
      - '**.yml'
      - '**.yaml'
	# allows manual run workflow in action tab
  workflow_dipatch:
```

## To Learn Why

```yaml
	# allows auto run by set time
	schedule:
    - cron: '28 9 * * 0'

	# ???
 strategy:
      matrix:
        runs-on: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }}
```

## To Deploy ??

```yaml
# `dist/index.js` is a special file in Actions.
# When you reference an action with `uses:` in a workflow,
# `index.js` is the code that will run.
# For our project, we generate this file through a build process
# from other source files.
# We need to make sure the checked-in `index.js` actually matches what we expect it to be.
- name: Compare the expected and actual dist/ directories
	run: |
		if [ "$(git diff --ignore-space-at-eol dist/ | wc -l)" -gt "0" ]; then
			echo "Detected uncommitted changes after build.  See status below:"
			git diff
			exit 1
		fi
# If dist/ was different than expected, upload the expected version as an artifact
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
	if: ${{ failure() && steps.diff.conclusion == 'failure' }}
	with:
		name: dist üìÅ
		path: dist/
```
